Hi, I’m @planetvnus\n
I’m interested in collaborating with others.
I’m currently learning C++. It's only been three weeks so far, I borrowed a book from the library that teaches children how to code in C++ so that I can learn in
a more fun way. I'm trying to take it slow and not do too many things at once. I hope one day I can laugh at all the programmer memes I see on Reddit.
